               At New Hope, we know that what we value is what we will do or become. Here are some of the things that make up who we are and what we do as a church body!
            </p>
<br/>
            <p>
<span class="section-head-desc">We Are Generous – </span> We truly believe it when Jesus said, “It is more blessed to give
than it is to receive.” At New Hope, we are generous with our time, talent and treasure knowing that we contribute to the
Kingdom of God!
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    <span class="section-head-desc">We Are Servants – </span>Service isn’t just something we do at New Hope but it is a part
    of our identity as sons and daughters of God. We know that if we want to be great, we must be servant to all! From the
    set up team to the pulpit, we are all serving!
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    <span class="section-head-desc">We Are United –</span> We know that one of the most important things in any church is
    that we are united. We may be different by age, ethnicity or background but we are all united in Christ!
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    <span class="section-head-desc"> We Are Holy – </span>As a church body, we want to grow in our relationship with Jesus
    and the lifestyle we live. Anyone and everyone is welcome to our church but we pray everyone leaves looking and loving
    like Jesus and seeking personal holiness.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    <span class="section-head-desc">We Are Messengers –</span> At New Hope, this is clear; we are all about the message of
    Jesus! We are unashamed and sold out for God, so we will stop at nothing to proclaim the true gospel message everywhere
    we go!
