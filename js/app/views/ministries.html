				<h3 class="section-head">Men’s</h3>
			
			<p>
				The Men’s Ministry at New Hope Chapel is a pillar of our church. Our mission is to encourage and equip men to know the Bible, teach it, and faithfully follow Christ as husbands, fathers, and friends. Our core program, Men’s Fraternity, gives us a definition of manhood from which to work, and a road on which to walk. In addition to the Men’s Fraternity and many weekly life groups, we are pleased to host the Teleios Men’s Summit annually. The Teleios Men’s Summit is a large conference with a focus on helping men live out the image of God in all areas of their lives by connecting with God and with other men.
